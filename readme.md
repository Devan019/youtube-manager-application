# YouTube Manager Application

This application is designed to manage YouTube data using three different storage methods. The project is organized into three main folders:

1. **By Txt File**: This folder contains the implementation that manages YouTube data using plain text files.
2. **By SQLite**: This folder contains the implementation that manages YouTube data using an SQLite database.
3. **By MongoDB**: This folder contains the implementation that manages YouTube data using a MongoDB database.
